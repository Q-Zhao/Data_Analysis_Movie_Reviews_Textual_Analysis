##Brief Description:

This project is a team case study in class DS501 (Introduction to Data Science) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). In this case, we have studied and built a sentiment analysis and polarity model to analyze a movie review dataset by fitting a linear classifier on features extracted from the text of the user messages, in order to guess whether the opinion of the author is positive or negative.
